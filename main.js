Is Christmas cancelled???

Count up the santa emojis (🎅) in a given string. 

If there's less than 4 (🎅) return 'No, Ho, Ho 😔 because Christmas has been cancelled....'

If there's between 4 - 12 (🎅) return 'Santa Claus is coming... so still be good!'

If there's 13 (🎅) return 'Merry Christmas, you can have a mulled wine 🎄🍷❄️'

There is never more than 13 (🎅) so that's the max number you need to worry about.

"T🎅his is our🎅 Christmas stri🎅ng" --> 'No, Ho, Ho 😔 because Christmas has been cancelled....'
"T🎅🎅his🎅 is🎅 our🎅🎅🎅 Christ🎅mas stri🎅🎅ng" --> 'Santa Claus is coming... so still be good!';
"🎅T🎅🎅his🎅 is🎅 our🎅🎅🎅 Christ🎅🎅mas st🎅ri🎅🎅ng" --> 'Merry Christmas, you can have a mulled wine 🎄🍷❄️';
