Is Christmas cancelled???

INSTRUCTIONS
Count up the number of Xs in a given string. 

If there's less than 4 (X) return 'No, Ho, Ho :( because Christmas has been cancelled....'

If there's between 4 - 12 (X) return 'Santa Claus is coming... so still be good!'

If there's 13 (X) return 'Merry Christmas, you can have a mulled wine!'

There is never more than 13 (X) so that's the max number you need to worry about.

*BEWARE* 
There are Santa emojis hidden in the string so you might want to think about removing them first and then count the number of (X)...
In the spirit of Christmas, we will give you a hint ---> you might want to take a look at match() array method ðŸ˜‰ 

EXAMPLE
