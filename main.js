Is Christmas cancelled???

Count up the number of Xs in a given string. 

If there's less than 4 (X) return 'No, Ho, Ho :( because Christmas has been cancelled....'

If there's between 4 - 12 (X) return 'Santa Claus is coming... so still be good!'

If there's 13 (X) return 'Merry Christmas, you can have a mulled wine'

There is never more than 13 (X) so that's the max number you need to worry about.

"TXhis is ourX Christmas striXng" --> 'No, Ho, Ho :( because Christmas has been cancelled....'
"TXXhisX isX ourXXX ChristXmas striXXng" --> 'Santa Claus is coming... so still be good!';
"XTXXhisX isX ourXXX ChristXXmas stXriXXng" --> 'Merry Christmas, you can have a mulled wine';
